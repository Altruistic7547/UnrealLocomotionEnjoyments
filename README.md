# AdvanceLocomotionSystemUnrealEngineEnjoyment

## Project Overview
**Advance Locomotion System Unreal Engine Enjoyment** is a personal project focused on exploring and customizing the **Advanced Locomotion System (ALS)** in **Unreal Engine** to create dynamic and interactive gameplay mechanics. 

This project extends the base features of ALS to include advanced interactions, item pickup, and weapon systems, enriching player experiences and gameplay depth.

## Why This Project?
- To implement and customize the **Advanced Locomotion System** for seamless, realistic player movement.

- To develop additional gameplay features such as **item pickup**, **weapon systems**, and **interaction components**.

- To enhance the project with gameplay mechanics like **switches**, **shooting**, and **toggling**.

## Key Features
- **Advanced Locomotion**: Integrated ALS for fluid and realistic player movements including running, jumping, crouching, and transitions.

- **Pickup System**: Custom pickup functionality that allows the player to collect items and integrate them into the inventory.
- **Weapon System**: Developed weapon mechanics that include equipping, aiming, shooting, and reloading, with customizable weapon properties.
- **Interaction Components**: Added versatile interactions such as:
  - **Switches**: Toggleable switches that affect game elements (e.g., doors, lights).
  - **Shooting Mechanisms**: Basic shooting functionality tied to the weapon system for gameplay and combat.
  - **Toggle Interactions**: Components that allow the player to toggle between different states or activate in-game objects.
- **Custom Animations**: Extended ALS with animations for picking up items and interacting with game elements.
- **StylizedCharacter**: Developed modular character styling system that allows player to customise player looks (head, body, hair, clothes) anyhow they want!

## Tools and Technologies
- **Unreal Engine (UE 4.26)**: Game engine used for development.

- **Advanced Locomotion System (ALS)**: Open-source system providing a foundation for advanced character movement.
- **Blueprints**: Visual scripting for quick prototyping and interaction logic.
- **C++**: Used for deeper customizations and performance-critical mechanics.
- **Animation Blueprint**: Customized to include new animations and transitions for interaction.
- **3D Assets**: Custom assets created using **Blender** and integrated into Unreal Engine for realistic props and weapons.

## Project file structure

I have made sure to follow official unreal engine documentation and found out the best practices. One of the best practice is to create seamless reusable and developer friendly file structure.
